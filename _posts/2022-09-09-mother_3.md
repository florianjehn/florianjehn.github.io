[Part II](https://florianjehn.github.io/2022-06-04-mother_2/)\
\
Mother of a thousand suns\
Praised she is in bondage\
Always will her touch be mana\
Given in love, beyond it\
\
Once moving in solitude\
Now interactions thriving\
She clears the path in longitude\
To forge ahead so shining\
\
The well of resonance she keeps building\
Digging into the source\
I hope her star shines ever brighter\
And know she keeps on striving
