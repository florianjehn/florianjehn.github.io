Mother of a thousand suns\
arriving to be seen\
understood and felt in new ways\
exploring just a dream?\
\
Grand, strange gestures\
fleeting moments\
Which way is the path?\
\
Mysteries in face and facts rise\
Ripples shroud the seas\
Waking up with new directions\
Feelings being free\
Point towards the heat of being\
rusted frames melt down\
\
Showing\
Knowing\
Understanding\
It is happening\
