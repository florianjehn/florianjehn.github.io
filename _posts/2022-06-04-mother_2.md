[Part I](https://florianjehn.github.io/2022-03-23-mother/)\
\
Mother of a thousand suns\
Once again paths cross\
Closer every turn they meet\
But freedom never lost\
\
Many crossroads still to find\
Decisions never last\
Onward ever, forwardbound\
The future turns to past\
\
Bound by choice\
Meeting as equals\
There is no rivalry\
\
Loving\
Feeling\
Ever calling\
\
You and I are free
