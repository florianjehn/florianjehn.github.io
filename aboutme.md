Hi, I'm Florian :)

I see myself as an agreeable and curious person, who likes to explore the world in a playful manner. My main interests are climate change, existential risks, feminism, history, forecasting and food security. 

After doing a bachelor, master and doctor in environmental science I am currently trying to explore how I can work on more impactful topics as those I have covered until now.
