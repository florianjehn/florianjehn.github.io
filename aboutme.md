subtitle: Researcher trying to understand the world and my thoughts
---


Hi, I'm Florian :)

I see myself as an agreeable and curious person, who likes to explore the world in a playful manner. My main interests are climate change, existential risks, feminism, history, forecasting and food security. 

After doing a bachelor, master and doctor in environmental science I am currently trying to explore how I can work on more impactful topics as those I have covered in the past. 

If I am not engaged in one of the topics above it is likely that you find me doing sport, meditation, reading, going for a walk or enjoying time with the wonderful people in my life.
